  I'm a self-taught engineer obsessed with building secure, efficient, and fair distributed systems. [cite_start]I founded <a href="https://github.com/zmlAEQ/Aequa-network">Aequa Network</a> to tackle the centralization and MEV problems in L2s with a pragmatic, "Trojan Horse" strategyâ€”first securing existing sequencers, then activating fairness[cite: 103, 144].
