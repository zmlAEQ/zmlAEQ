  I'm a self-taught engineer obsessed with building secure, efficient, and fundamentally fair distributed systems from first principles. I founded <a href="https://github.com/zmlAEQ/Aequa-network">Aequa Network</a> to tackle the centralization and MEV problems in L2s with a pragmatic, "Trojan Horse" strategy‚Äîfirst securing existing sequencers, then activating fairness.

### ‚ú® My Core Vision: Fairness as a Service (FaaS)

I believe **FaaS will be the next crypto consensus**‚Äîensuring bias-free DeFi lending and MEV-proof networks. Aequa Network is engineered to pioneer this paradigm.

- **Modular DVT Engine:** Built in Go for maximum performance and security.
- **Production-Ready:** Architected with strong observability, fail-fast design, and atomic state persistence.
- **Radically Transparent:** Open-source and continuously hardened with long-duration fuzzing, chaos engineering, and comprehensive CI/CD security gates.

### üß† What I'm Exploring

- **Layer 2 Infrastructure:** Architecting the next generation of scalable and decentralized L2 solutions, from P2P networking to novel consensus mechanisms.
- **Applied Cryptography & Privacy:** Implementing cryptographic primitives to build secure, privacy-preserving systems, such as leveraging encryption to eliminate front-running (BEAST-MEV).
- **Game Theory & Mechanism Design:** Modeling incentive systems (like Dual Flow Batch Auctions) to create fair and manipulation-resistant economic protocols.
- **AI & Distributed Systems:** Building intelligent, autonomous multi-agent systems with frameworks like LangGraph to enhance decentralized protocols.
- **Secure Software Supply Chains:** Automating security best practices from commit to deployment, using tools like Snyk and `govulncheck` to ensure code integrity.
